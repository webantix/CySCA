                    <p class="text-muted">CySCA is Australia’s only national cyber security competition. It’s designed to excite, inspire, attract and help Australia’s talented people to become our next generation of cybersecurity professionals.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted">A partnership of Australian Government, business and academia deliver CySCA each year. In 2015, our partners are the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Australian Signals Directorate, Cisco Systems Australia and New Zealand, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Facebook, HackLabs, Microsoft, PwC and Telstra.</p>
                    <p class="text-muted"> We are also working with over 20 tertiary institutions including the Australian National University, Canberra Institute of Technology, Curtin University, Deakin University, Edith Cowan University, Flinders University, Macquarie University, Murdoch University, Queensland University of Technology, Swinburne University of Technology, University of Melbourne, University of New South Wales, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, University of Sydney and the University of Technology Sydney.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Background</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted">As Australians conduct more of their social, consumer and business activities online, there is a corresponding increase in the demand for ICT professionals to manage the digital environment. The Government is committed to working with Australia’s private sector to help boost our cyber security skills base and equip our workforce with the skills necessary to thrive in a digital economy. The Government recognises that developing and sustaining an appropriately skilled ICT workforce will ensure Australia’s future prosperity, security and social wellbeing.</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">All teams must be registered by a university/TAFE staff/faculty academic representative.</p>

                            collect is accurate, up to date and complete. These steps include maintaining and updating personal 
                            information when we are advised by individuals that their personal information has changed, and at other 
                            times as necessary.

                            steps include limited access for electronic files, securing paper files in locked cabinets and physical 
                            access restrictions.

                        <p>
                            If an individual requests access to the personal information we hold about them, or requests that we
                            change that personal information, we will allow access or make the changes unless we consider that there
                            is a sound reason under the <em>Privacy Act,  Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOI Act)</em> or 
                            other relevant law to withhold the information. If we do not agree to provide access to personal 
                            information the individual may seek a review of our decision or may appeal our decision under the FOI 
                            Act. If we do not agree to make requested changes to personal information the individual may make a 
                            statement about the requested changes and we will attach this to the record. Individuals can obtain 
                            further information about how to request access or changes to the information we hold about them by 
                            contacting us.

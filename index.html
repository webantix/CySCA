                    <p>CySCA is a ‘hacking’ competition run by an alliance of Australian Government, business and academic professionals who are committed to finding the next generation of Australian cyber security talent – including you!</p>
                    <p>Run every year since 2012, CySCA will show you what it’s like to work in cyber security and will get your name in front of some of Australia’s most dynamic employers. And then there are the <a class="page-scroll" href="#prizes">prizes</a> up for grabs... </p>
                    <p>CySCA is Australia’s only national cyber security competition. It runs over 24-hours and will test both your technical skills and communication know-how. It’s not easy, but it’s heaps of fun, and the opportunities you get from participating are fantastic. </p>
                    <p>Think you’re up for the Challenge? <a class="page-scroll" href="#registration">Click here to find out more…</a></p>

                            <p>The Department’s privacy policy contains information about how an individual may access the personal information about the individual that is held and seek correction of such information.  The privacy policy also contains information about how an individual may complain about a breach of the policy and how the Department will manage that complaint. The policy is available online at this address: <a href="http://www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/accountability-and-reporting/pmc-privacy-practices/privacy-policy">www.dpmc.gov.au/pmc/accountability-and-reporting/pmc-privacy-practices/privacy-policy <i class="fa fa-external-link"></i></a></p>

                            <h3>Publication</h3>
                            <p>The information you provide may also be used in Cyber Security Challenge Australia promotional material, media coverage and posted online.

                            <p>The Department also takes steps to protect the personal information we hold against loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure and against other misuse.

                            <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">2014 In-a-Box</h3>
                            <p>CySCA2014-in-a-Box is a Virtual Machine that contains most of the challenges faced by players during the 2014 Cyber Security Challenge. It allows players to complete challenges in their own time, to learn and develop their cyber security skills. The VM includes a static version of the scoring panel with all challenges, required files and flags.</p>

                            <p><a href="http://goo.gl/6ftZ39" class="btn btn-large btn-primary" role="button"><i class="fa fa-download"></i> Download CySCA2014-in-a-Box</a></p>

                            <p>Download size is 367M.</p>

                            <p>To use CySCA2014 in a box virtual machines, players will need to have either Oracle VirtualBox or VMWare Player installed on their machines. Additionally we recommend players have at least 4GB of RAM. If you have less RAM, you can reduce the amount of RAM available to the VM down to 512MB, however it may adversely affect the speed of some of the challenges. </p>

                            <p><strong>
                                CAUTION: The VM contains software that is deliberately vulnerable. We advise that you do not attach it to a critical network. Consider using your virtualisation software's host&dash;only network functionality. 
                            </strong></p>

                            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Extract files from CySCA2014InABox.7z </li>
                                <li>Navigate to the folder containing the extracted files</li>
                                <li>Confirm that the checksums for the files match those in checksums.txt</li>
                                <li>If you are using <b>VirtualBox</b> double click the CySCA2014InABox.vbox file. When you start the VM, you may be prompted that a "Centrino Advanced" adapter is not found. If this happens, click Change Network Settings and select the adapter that you would like the VM to bridge to. <br/></li>
                                <strong>
                                    &dash;&dash; Or &dash;&dash; <br/>
                                </strong>
                                <li>If you are using <b>VMWare Player</b> double click the CySCA2014InABox.vmx file. When you start the VM, you may be asked if the VM has been moved or copied. Select copied.</li>
                                <li>If DHCP is available on the network adapter you have selected the VM will request an IP address and you will be prompted with the allocated IP. If no IP is specified you will need to set one before connecting. See instructions below. </li>
                                <li>Use your browser to connect to http://&lt;VMip&gt;/.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <h4>Setting a Static IP</h4>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Login to the VM using the username <b>user</b> and the password <b>CYSCA2014user</b>.</li>
                                <li>Use sudo and your favorite editor (vim and nano are installed) to edit <b>/etc/network/interfaces</b> to set a static IP.</li>
                                <li>Reboot the VM for your static IP to take effect. Then follow step 6 in Getting Started.</li>
                            </ol>
